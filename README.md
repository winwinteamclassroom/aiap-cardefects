The README is expected to contain the following:
a. Full name (as in NRIC) and email address (stated in your application form).
b. Overview of the submitted folder and the folder structure.
c. Instructions for executing the pipeline and modifying any parameters.
d. Description of logical steps/flow of the pipeline. If you find it useful, please feel free to
include suitable visualization aids (eg, flow charts) within the README.
e. Overview of key findings from the EDA conducted in Task 1 and the choices made in the
pipeline based on these findings, particularly any feature engineering. Please keep the
details of the EDA in the `.ipynb`. The information in the `README.md` should be a quick
summary of the details from `.ipynb`.
f. Described how the features in the dataset are processed (summarized in a table)
g. Explanation of your choice of models for each machine learning task.
h. Evaluation of the models developed. Any metrics used in the evaluation should also be
explained.
i. Other considerations for deploying the models developed.

Evaluation
The submitted MLP, including the `README.md`, will be used to assess your understanding of machine
learning models/algorithms as well as your ability to design and develop a machine learning pipeline.
Specifically, you will be assessed on

Appropriate data preprocessing and feature engineering
Appropriate use and optimization of algorithms/models
Appropriate explanation for the choice of algorithms/models
Appropriate use of evaluation metrics
Appropriate explanation for the choice of evaluation metrics
Understanding of the different components in the machine learning pipeline

In your submitted Python scripts (`.py` files), you will be assessed on the quality of your code in terms of
reusability, readability, and self-explanatory.
Please note that your submission will be heavily penalized for any of the following conditions:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
Incorrect format for `requirements.txt`
`run.sh` fails upon execution
Poorly structured `README.md`
Disorganized code that fails to make use of functions and/or classes for reusability
MLP not submitted in Python scripts (`.py` files), including MLP built using Jupyter Notebooks.
